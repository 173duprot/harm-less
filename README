/* --- harm-less ---*/
Inspired by suckless and cat-v, this is a simple single text document wiki of
minimal software and suckless practices.

-- Each Topic is a folder       [TOPIC]
-- Each tool is a file          [TOOL]
-- each file is a description

This list is genarated using  tree.sh  on ./wiki

programming
├── languages
│   ├── C - fuck C++
│   ├── Forth - More powerful and minimal than C, also more dangerous, good for embedded
│   ├── Python - Good for scripting, not for applications
│   └── Rust - better C++ alternative
└── text-manupulation
    ├── core-utils - awk, sed, cat, tail, etc.
    └── python - like I said, scripting. Shell is better but python aint that bad.
system
├── core-utils
│   ├── busybox - tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small embedded executable
│   └── plan9-coreutils - The most minimal you can get, everything is only a couple lines of C. Best of the best.
├── display-server
│   ├── swc - The smallest display server you will ever get. Wayland compositor in 10k sloc.
│   └── wlroots - bloat, but nowhere near as bad as Xorg.
├── init
│   ├── OpenRC - Bit bloated, but by far the most popular of the init's here.
│   ├── busybox - busybox has a good minimal embedded init system.
│   ├── runit - ungodly small init scheme, very powerful
│   └── sinit - The suckless init system
├── os
│   ├── Alpine - A very popular just-works embedded linux build around musl libc and busybox.
│   ├── Gentoo - The most popular distro here, source based, can be made suckless.
│   ├── Glaucus - Brand new bleeding-edge linux built round musl libc and toybox.
│   ├── KISS - Kiss linux is new, decently well known, and ungodly simple. Links hard to find k1sslinux.org
│   ├── Oasis - manual-bootstrapped, statically compiled incredibly simple source-based linux.
│   ├── OpenBSD - Very clean codebase, very simple, very secure, smallst kernal
│   ├── Sabotage - Manual bootstrapped ultraminimal source-based static linux.
│   ├── minix - The simpelest embedded microkernal os possible, powers the IME in intel chips.
│   └── plan9 - (or 9front) The most minimal of all, Only use if you are a full autismo.
└── terminal
    ├── emulator
    │   ├── st - the suckless terminal emulator. Tiny, easy to understand, customizable, perfect.
    │   └── termite - Almost as minimal as st, less hackable, more user-freindly.
    └── multiplexer
        ├── dvtm-abduco - better tmux, tiny minimal terminal multiplexing, emulates DWM in the tty.
        └── tmux - a bit bloated, but ungodly popular.
